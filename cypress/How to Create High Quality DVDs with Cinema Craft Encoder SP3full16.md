Cinema Craft Encoder SP3full16 offers a simple interface, but one that is highly incomprehensible to inexperienced users. It lets you configure countless options, such as the type of compression to be done, number of passes, aspect ratio, output resolution, number of frames per second, audio quality, etc[^1^]. It is one of the most complete tools of this type out there today.
 
Cinema Craft Encoder SP3full16 is not equivalent of the CCE-SP, but rather CCE-Xtream. It is faster than real time (RT) encoding for full HD input (1920x1080), but you need quad core xeons. It also has segment based re-encoding, which can save you a lot of time[^2^]. It is not for private people, but for studios that need high quality and fast encoding.
 
If you are interested in Cinema Craft Encoder SP3full16, you can download it from Uptodown for free[^1^]. However, you will need a dedicated PC with the following configuration: OS: WindowsÂ® XP Professional, x64 Edition / CPU: 2x Dual core 3GHz Intel XeonÂ® processor 5160 Memory: 8GB 4x FB-DIMM 667(2GB) / HDD: 4TB Serial ATA (RAID 0) Video Card: NVIDIA GeForce 7950GT / Network: Fibre Channel[^2^].
 
Cinema Craft Encoder SP3full16 is a powerful and professional video compression tool for DVD that can deliver high quality results in a short time. If you are looking for a software that can handle your video projects with ease and efficiency, Cinema Craft Encoder SP3full16 might be the right choice for you.
  
Cinema Craft Encoder SP3full16 has some unique features that make it stand out from other MPEG-2 encoders. For example, it supports segment re-encoding, which allows you to re-encode only a specific part of the video without affecting the rest. This can save you a lot of time and disk space when you need to make minor adjustments or corrections[^2^]. It also supports multi-pass encoding, which can improve the quality and efficiency of the compression[^1^].
 
Cinema Craft Encoder SP3full16 also comes with a plug-in for Compressor 3, which is a video encoding and transcoding software for Mac OS X. This plug-in enables you to use the Cinema Craft Xtream software encoding engine within Compressor 3, and take advantage of all its functions, such as frame controls, geometry settings, filters, etc[^3^]. This way, you can integrate Cinema Craft Encoder SP3full16 into your workflow and enjoy its high quality and fast encoding.
 
If you need some assistance or guidance on how to use Cinema Craft Encoder SP3full16, you can download Cinema Craft Assist for SP3, which is a free tool that automates some of the tasks involved in encoding with Cinema Craft Encoder SP3full16. For example, it can automatically generate an encode list file and pass it to Cinema Craft Encoder SP3full16, run DGIndex on the resultant MPEG-2 files, and use AVISynth and SSIM plugin to show you the results of the encodes and let you visually inspect the differences between different settings[^4^] [^5^]. Cinema Craft Assist for SP3 can also generate a SSIM quality chart that shows you how well your encoding settings match your source video[^5^].
